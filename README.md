##### 🙋‍♂️ About me
<p> I am a software developer from <i> Kashmir </i> I have been into coding since 2018. It was a startup idea that made me jump into this amazing field then with time I realized the power and freedom of developing anything you imagine which made me stay in this field. I have worked on Front-end development, Back-end development, Mobile App development and quite recently I have started my journey towards AI . Apart from pressing keys on my laptop I love travel and photography 👨‍💻 🗺️ 📸
